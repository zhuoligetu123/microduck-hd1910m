//! `mediad` — camera, mic, WebRTC, and the remote gateway.
//!
//! Runs the signalling server in this process, streams video to whoever connects, and gives each
//! peer a `control` datachannel that is a pipe to the robot API. `docs/design/remote-webrtc.md` is
//! the design.
//!
//! ## What it does not do
//!
//! **It does not authenticate.** Anyone who reaches the signalling port can drive the robot and
//! see its camera. That is a decision, not an omission — §4 has the reasoning, and the short
//! version is that the pairing PIN is a shared `000000`, so a gate would add a step to every
//! connection and prove nothing. The bridge that makes a robot reachable from outside the LAN
//! authenticates on both sides before a session arrives.
//!
//! **It is not on the recovery path.** If `mediad` will not start, the robot still walks, still
//! takes an update, and is still reachable over Bluetooth. That is why it may depend on a plugin
//! from a release asset and a device node's group while `updaterd` may not.
