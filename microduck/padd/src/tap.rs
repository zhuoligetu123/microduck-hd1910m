//! The raw input tap: a second reader of the same pad, on a socket of its own.
//!
//! ## Why `padd` grew a socket to serve one read-only stream
//!
//! One question about a gamepad cannot be answered from anywhere else in this system. `padd` polls
//! the last known stick value and sends it at a steady 50 Hz, so a radio that has stopped
//! delivering reports still produces perfectly fresh intents: `robotd` sees a live driver, the
//! deadman never fires, and the robot keeps walking on a command nobody is still giving. Every
//! surface downstream — `robot.state`, the monitor's `requested` column, the journal — shows a
//! healthy robot, because from their side it is one.
//!
//! The evidence lives one layer below `padd`: the event stream itself, where a report that never
//! arrived leaves a hole in the cadence. So this hands that stream out unaltered rather than
//! summarising it, and lets whoever is investigating do the arithmetic.
//!
//! ## Why it reads the device a second time instead of forwarding what gilrs gives it
//!
//! `Gilrs::next_event` is not the raw stream and cannot be made into one. It applies three filters
//! by default — `axis_dpad_to_button`, `Jitter`, `deadzone` — which rewrite values, drop small
//! movements, and swallow whole events; `gilrs-core` turns `SYN_DROPPED` into an internal resync
//! flag that never reaches a consumer; and neither `SYN_REPORT` nor `MSC_SCAN` survives the trip.
//! Every one of those is a thing someone chasing an unreliable link needs to see.
//!
//! Opening the node twice costs nothing and takes nothing away: an evdev reader gets its own queue,
//! so this cannot starve gilrs of an event, and `scripts/pad-link-test.sh` has been reading the same
//! node alongside `padd` since before this existed. The node comes from gilrs itself
//! ([`gilrs::LinuxGamepadExt::devpath`]), which is the only way to be sure this is watching the pad
//! that is actually driving — one Xbox controller registers several input devices, and the first
//! one in `/proc/bus/input/devices` is a media-key keyboard that never sends anything.
//!
//! ## What it costs while nobody is watching
//!
//! Nothing. The device is not opened until a subscriber connects, and it is closed again after the
//! first report following the last one leaving — the same bargain `robotd` strikes by only
//! assembling a `robot.state` frame when someone is subscribed. A pad at rest is silent, so a
//! parked reader is not a wakeup either.
